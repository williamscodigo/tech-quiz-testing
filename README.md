# Tech Quiz Testing (Cypress) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

This project is designed to ensure the reliability and robustness of a Tech Quiz application by implementing comprehensive testing with Cypress. The app is built using the MERN stack, consisting of a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Users can take a quiz consisting of ten random questions and view their final score. The goal of this project is to enhance the application with component and end-to-end tests to ensure it functions as expected under various conditions.

## Technologies Used

- MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
- Cypress: For component and end-to-end testing
